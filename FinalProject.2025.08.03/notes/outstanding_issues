About.php:
1. No delete function yet for body, title, and image inputs

Photo.php:
1. Updated photo is not echoing on about page
- Photo is successfully being uploaded to uploads folder, and the filepath is reflected in the database
2. Still need photo validation re: size

Dashboard.php:
1. Delete user function works; still need an update user function

Site-wide:
1. Inconsistent error processing and echoing
- Something to clean up/do better in future
- Might make a utility class/file for more consistent error and echo functions
