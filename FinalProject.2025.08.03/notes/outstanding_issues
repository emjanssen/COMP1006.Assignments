About.php:
1. No delete function yet for body, title, and image inputs

Dashboard.php:
1. Delete user function works; still need an update user function

I know how to do these, but I gotta start working on a different project, so I'll come back to these in-future.

About.php/photo.php:
1. Photo upload functionality isn't working via FileZilla.
- As far as I can tell, the code is pointing to the right folder on the server, but the folder isn't writable.

Site-wide:
1. Inconsistent error processing and echoing
- Something to clean up/do better in future
- Might make a utility class/file for more consistent error and echo functions
- Am also going to make more consistent use of echoing messages on page load via something like:

// if we have success or error messages saved into our sessions, save those to a variable, then unset the error/success message
if (isset($_SESSION['success'])) {
    $success = $_SESSION['success'];
    unset($_SESSION['success']);
}

if (isset($_SESSION['error'])) {
    $error = $_SESSION['error'];
    unset($_SESSION['error']);
}

2. Right now, my directory retains all uploaded photos, even if the image is no longer in use (i.e. the user has uploaded a new one).
- Need to add functionality that removes extraneous image files from database.
